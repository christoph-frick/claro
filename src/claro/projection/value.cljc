;; ## Constructor

(defn value
  "A projection that replaces any value it encounters with the given one.
   `template` will be used for further projection, if given, otherwise [[leaf]]
   is used.

   Note that this projection can be used to inject values into a map, i.e. the
   result of

   ```clojure
   {:id       projection/leaf
    :name     projection/leaf
    :visible? (projection/value true)}
   ```

   will always contain a key `:visible?` with value `true` â€“ even if the
   original map had no such key."

  (->ValueProjection value (or template leaf)))
